# ReadMe Generator 

# Summary: 
For this weeks assignment, we were asked to create a readme generator that allows the user to easily create a readme that includes:
    - A project title
    - A description about the project
    - A how to install the project
    - How to use the project
    - Who contributed to the project
    - What they learned when making this project
    - Final Thoughts
    - A way to contact the creator of the project
    - For the type of license to be displayed

The end result of this project is displayed in the screenshots and video below.

# Getting Started: 
For this assignment, I decided to refer back to some of the activities, as well as the mini project as guides to get started on this homework. I figured out that the mini project that we did in class is very simmilar to this homework assignment, so I used that example as a guide in order to help me on creating the prompt of questions, as well as getting the prompt to convert into a fully functional readme. 

# Problems along the way:
One of the only things that I really struggled with is creating a Table of Contents that looked like an actual TOC, I spent a good 20 minutes or maybe more trying to figure out why it didnt look the way I wanted it, when I would test out the readme generator, the table of contents would look like:

* [Description] (#Description)
* [Installation] (#Installation)

When previewing it using the Command Pallette, when I wanted my TOC to look like: 

* Description
* Installation
* Etc.
Turns out, it was a rather small and kinda obvious mistake that took a simple backspace to fix. Looking back at it now, the mistake was kinda silly.

- Problem Number 2:
Another problem that I had was that the license badges wouldnt display, I went on @Lukas-H's GitHub to find the different types of badges that can be used as well as the license links. After doing a little bit of research on how to display them, nothing really seemed to be working so I just left the functions bank because I didnt want to mess anything up, this is something I need to fix for the future. 



# Final Thoughts:
Overall this assignment seemed very "chill" for me compared to the others we've done in class, I really feel like I learned alot about Node.Js and how it is very much useful in being able to create things

For me, creating a ReadMe feels like it takes way more time than it should, I know that I like to get in every little detail on what I did for the assignment, but sometimes it is a pain to make.
